## Motivation
Why This Topic?
In today's digital age, users often face the challenge of selecting the most suitable YouTube channels for their learning or entertainment needs. The abundance of options can lead to confusion and uncertainty. The YouTube Dashboard aims to address this issue by providing users with a comprehensive tool to evaluate and compare channels effectively.

How does This Dashboard help?
The YouTube Dashboard facilitates the comparison of two different channels based on their views and likes using a Box Plot visualization. This feature allows users to assess the popularity and engagement levels of channels, aiding in the decision-making process.

Additionally, the YouTube Dashboard supports YouTube analysts in conducting longitudinal analysis by providing a Timeline Chart. This enables analysts to track the performance of the best YouTube videos and channels over time, leading to valuable insights and strategic decisions.

Furthermore, the Dashboard offers insights into the types of content released in proportion on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis. This information, visualized through a Sunburst chart, proves highly beneficial for YouTube analysts, enabling them to understand trends and patterns within different content categories.

By providing these functionalities, the YouTube Dashboard enhances the user's ability to make informed decisions when selecting YouTube channels for learning or entertainment purposes.

# Project Information

## Name
YouTube Interactive Dashboard

## Introduction
This project showcases an example of an interactive dashboard implemented using Python. It offers a seamless experience of working with both the frontend and backend components simultaneously. The dashboard leverages the Plotly library to build interactive graphs and utilizes the Dash library to dynamically update the graphs.

## Video
A video demonstration of the YouTube Interactive Dashboard can be found [here](https://github.com/nikshingadiya/nikshingadiya.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/portfolio/Youtube/Dash%20-%20Google%20Chrome%202021-05-28%2021-22-38.mp4).

## Functionality
The dashboard provides the following functionalities:

- Filter Data by: Data table
- Current date with videos category-wise proportion by filter data: Sunburst chart
- Top 10 trending videos by date likes/views: Bar chart
- Channel-wise descriptive statistics: Table
- Most static likely: Bar plot
- Most static views: Bar plot
- Channel-wise comparison distribution of views and likes: Boxplot
- Longitudinal analysis of videos views: Timeline chart


## Advantages
- Dash Plotly is easy to learn and doesn't require extensive knowledge of JavaScript.
- Dash Plotly runs on Python, allowing us to harness the computational power of Python in our dashboard.
- Machine learning engineers commonly use Dash Plotly for visualizing their machine learning models, and it has become a strong competitor for tools like Microsoft BI and Tableau.
- Beginner-level analysts can easily implement their own dashboards using Dash Plotly.

## Disadvantage
- If the dataset contains a large number of rows, the chart loading and updating time may increase.


## Extra Concept
The project introduces the concept of internal structure callback, demonstrating how the internal callback works when the dropdown and graph changes. It explains two types of callbacks: Default Callback by Dash (Slower) and ClientSide Callback by JavaScript (Faster).
